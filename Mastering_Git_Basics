Tom Preston-Werner
2010
 * 05:40 creating working directory
 * 07:00 only one directory (.git) for whole directory (many .svn in contrast)
 * 07:35 index
 * 08:45 git add
 * 09:35 staging is copying into index, not only referencing, linking
 * 10:31 git status
 * 10:28 git commit
 * 10:29 commit is a snapshot taken from the index, and NOT the working directory
 * 12:32 git log
 * 14:42 git diff
 * 14:55 git diff is showing difference between index and working directory
 * 15:21 git add -p (-p is interactive)
 * 17:03 git diff --staged (difference between index and last commit)
 * 20:40 every commit has a parent
 * 20:52 git stores history as graph of commits
 * 21:08 Branching and Merging
 * 21:19 git branch
 * 21:43 The default branch is named master
 * 21:15 Branches are just pointers to commits
